# dupes-not-included
Shuffle duplicants until it finds one that meets a specified criteria!

I'm just a beginner at this so this script probably contains loads of bugs, doesn't work for any other resolution than 1080p and breaks a whole load of programming practices. Also, it's pretty slow at shuffling duplicants, so try not to put in too specific a criteria. 

There's plenty left to do with this project as well: 
1. Extend its functionality to other resolutions. 
2. Optimizing the script so that it can shuffle through duplicants at a faster rate. 
3. Add ability to build a comparison dictionary. 
4. Add duplicant templates.
